## Why does this coin exist? 😯

It’s a fun way to get people into crypto, with the vision of one day helping those who are battling against a shitty time in in life with increadible gains.  

### How does this coin grow? 🧐

The success of this coin is heavily dependent on degenerates to push it to new heights, and its tokenomics which makes it a deflationary asset.  
|  Supply  |   Liqudiity    |      Buy Back     |  Development   |
|  ------- |    ------      |       ------      |    ------      |
|   21m    |   2% per Tx    |      2% per Tx    |   2% per Tx    |

There are NO team tokens and NO ridiculously high taxes! Every single penny of tax collected gets pumped straight back into the project.


## How do I get coins? 😆 

You can obtain coins from Defi cryptocurrency exchanges such as Pancakeswap ahead of our Safemoon Exchange
